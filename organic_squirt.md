# Notes on organic squirt

TTR only allows for a single gag track to be organic, so one part of every
toon&rsquo;s loadout (besides what gag tracks they actually have access to) is
what track they choose to plant. Typically the choice is between sound and
throw. Lure is a common choice for those training lure and for those who rely
heavily on lure when playing with others they don&rsquo;t know (and thus cannot
trust to properly stun for the lure). Trap and drop are also fairly useful and
are occasionally seen, but their usefulness is marginal within
&rdquo;normal&ldquo; play; most organic trap users that I have met say that
they mostly just wanted their railroad to one-shot level 12s. Organic toonup is
vastly underpowered in normal play, and is thus *exceedingly* rare.

These notes focus on the (in my opinion) severely underestimated underdog of
the bunch: organic squirt. No attempt is here made (other than in the
preliminary) to convince the reader to use organic squirt, and your mileage may
vary wildly depending on which gag tracks you have access to, who you play
with, and what cogs in the game you fight the most. Instead, these are notes
(maybe even a kind of guide) based on *my personal experience* (with all the
associated arithmetic included, of course) using organic squirt on soundless
toons (with variously 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 gag tracks on each toon). This is not an
exhaustive list of every possible way of defeating any given level of cog using
at least one organic squirt gag; this is a practical guide that does deal with
discrete strategies, but only ones that *make practical sense* within
playstyles that I have personally encountered. Plenty of possibly viable
strategies are indeed *intentionally omitted* here.

These notes are split into two parts: a short preliminary/introduction,
followed by a collection of notes on strategies that can be used with organic
squirt.

The strategies covered here are roughly divided up into three kinds: pure,
mixed, and situational. &ldquo;Pure&rdquo; strategies are straightforward and
only involve squirt gags (although they may deal with cogs that are lured or
unlured). &ldquo;Mixed&rdquo; strategies are only slightly less
straightforward, and involve at least one gag track that isn&rsquo;t squirt.
&ldquo;Situational&rdquo; strategies are not quite so straightforward, and are
situational in the sense that they generally span multiple rounds (thus only
making sense within certain cog fights, not just against certain individual
cogs) and/or require special preparation. Within each of the three kinds,
strategies are not in order of &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; or anything like that,
but are merely ordered by the following, in descending order of priority:

1. Strategies that involve one or more v2.0 cogs are ordered first;
2. Strategies are ordered by the highest level of cog that is involved,
   descending;
3. Strategies that do not involve lure are ordered first;
4. Strategies that involve fewer organic squirt gags are ordered first.

Tie-breaking after this is arbitrary. This ordering is supposed to reflect
something like (very roughly) &ldquo;higher raw gag damage comes first&rdquo;.

## Preliminary

### Why organic squirt?

It is common for people to assume that organic squirt is useless; after all,
squirt gags do less damage per-gag than, say, throw gags (and drop gags, and
trap gags), and organic status gives extra damage per-gag as a multiple of the
gag&rsquo;s base damage. So, naturally, it is assumed that organic squirt is
plain old inferior to the other option(s).

This is a misunderstanding based on an (extremely) crude evaluation of the
value of gags themselves. This misunderstanding is, however, entirely expected
given that:

1. *Most* cog facilities are not that lengthy (in terms of something like the
   sum of all cogs&rsquo; raw HP values), so in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; play, you
   can simply sound-spam your way through all, or almost all, of the facility.
   Once a facility is complete, toons are free to restock their gags at any gag
   shoppe.
2. Although Toontown (in general: including not just TTO, but also TTR and
   other &ldquo;private servers&rdquo; that are ultimately derivatives of TTO)
   is a game *designed to force teamwork*, due to the previous point, players
   are *de facto* only incentivised to go as far as memorizing a few
   &ldquo;combos&rdquo; that require little (if any) team coordination. More
   &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; players only go slightly further than this (with
   cooperation strategies like e.g. the avoidance of &ldquo;crossing&rdquo;),
   ultimately also wanting the same thing: a small, fixed set of gag combos
   (ideally as simple as possible, like a single-gag combo, a.k.a. one-shot
   combo) that can be easily memorized by all toons in common, each one of
   which otherwise *requires no teamwork* other than having a shared set of
   memorized combos.
3. Toons cannot (again, in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; play) go sad.

If the above three points are all collectively a given as far as you&rsquo;re
concerned, then this document is probably not for you. If all three points
above are true 100% of the time, then you are better off with either organic
sound or organic throw, as those are the only two viable options (in terms of
raw game-mechanical advantage, with the slight exception of an organic Storm
Cloud being able to one-shot a lured level 10 cog). That being said, there are
two things that make the above three assumptions questionable:

1. The existence of Bossbot HQ, specifically Back Nines and CEOs. Depending on
   how lucky you get with the golf minigame, point no. 1 above may or may not
   actually apply. And in CEOs, there is simply no chance (other than the
   spending of SOS cards and/or unites) of getting gag restocks. This point
   also applies to a lesser extent to some shorter facilities like Middle
   Sixes, DA Office Ds, Bullion Mints, and CFOs.
2. The existence of alternate (not &ldquo;normal&rdquo;) styles of play, which
   are ultimately optional (as is any style of play), and sometimes require
   self-imposed restrictions beyond what the game provides as-is. This includes
   (but is not limited to) soundless toons, semi toons, and uber toons (and
   toons that are any combination of one or more of the former).

If we take these things into account (and thus take the original three
assumptions into question), we arrive at a more *general* version of Toontown,
in which the reasoning that organic squirt is obviously useless no longer
applies. Instead, when reasoning about what organic gag track to choose, our
reasoning has to look more like the following rough sketch:

We want to *minimize* the amount of &ldquo;power&rdquo; (loosely speaking, the
somewhat situational power-to-defeat-cogs that takes into account raw gag
damage as well as other things like ability to produce &ldquo;combo
damage&rdquo; (yellow damage) and &ldquo;knockback damage&rdquo; (orange
damage), &amp;c.) that is used to defeat any given cog (or set of cogs). In
this way, we *maximize* how much power we conserve overall that can be used to
defeat future cog(s).

If it seems like this reasoning still views organic squirt as useless (or at
least, underpowered), then you are forgetting that Toontown puts an absolute
maximum on the number of gags that you can carry of any particular variety
(e.g. a hard maximum of 3 Birthday Cakes). Because of this, it will (at least,
in many cases) make sense to empower gags that are less powerful per-gag, thus
having more gags in one&rsquo;s inventory that exceed a particular power
threshold. This is as opposed to empowering gags that are *more* powerful
per-gag; doing this will increase the number of gags in one&rsquo;s inventory
that exceed a particular power threshold, but that threshold *will be
considerably higher, and as a result the absolute number of gags that exceed it
will be fewer anyways*. This can actually work *against* the criteria in the
previous paragraph, and is the (somewhat subtle) reasoning that vindicates the
use of seemingly underpowered things like organic squirt.

All of this being said, it is worth reiterating that I in no way claim that
organic squirt is the only viable option for an organic gag track in all
situations, because that claim is very much false. What I do claim is that in
many situations and in many gag builds, organic squirt is a good choice and/or
the best choice. I also claim that in my personal experience, organic squirt
has served me very well across a variety of different toons with different gag
tracks.

### Basic squirt knowledge

The damage values of squirt gags (and their organic versions) are listed below:

| Level | Name             | Damage | Damage (Organic) |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| 1     | Squirting Flower | 4      | 5                |
| 2     | Glass Of Water   | 8      | 9                |
| 3     | Squirtgun        | 12     | 13               |
| 4     | Seltzer Bottle   | 21     | 23               |
| 5     | Fire Hose        | 30     | 33               |
| 6     | Storm Cloud      | 80     | 88               |
| 7     | Geyser           | 105    | 115              |

Squirt gags are effectively as accurate as sound gags (slightly complicated by
the fact that sound gags hit all cogs, and squirt gags hit one cog at a time
with the exception of the Geyser). Toons with max squirt have a 95% chance of
hitting any unlured cog with their squirt gags, and all toons have a 100%
chance of hitting any lured cog with their squirt gags.

## Pure strategies

### P0a

**2 non-organic hoses**, **1 non-organic Storm Cloud**, and **1 organic Storm
Cloud** takes out an **unlured level 10 v2.0** cog.

#### The math

```python
# First shell
  30 + 30 + 80
= 140

# Second shell
  88 + ceil((30 + 30 + 80 + 88) / 5)
= 88 + ceil(228                 / 5)
= 88 + ceil(45.6)
= 88 + 46
= 134
```

#### When

In a lureless context where you have 2 or more dropless toons (actually
dropless, or just don&rsquo;t have any Safes left).

### P0b

**1 organic Seltzer Bottle**, **1 non-organic hose**, **1 non-organic Storm
Cloud**, and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an **unlured level 10 v2.0**
cog.

#### The math

```python
# First shell
  23 + 30 + 80
= 133

# Second shell
  88 + ceil((23 + 30 + 80 + 88) / 5)
= 88 + ceil(221                 / 5)
= 88 + ceil(44.2)
= 88 + 45
= 133
```

#### When

This is just P0a, but with two organic squirt gags required. The same comments
apply.

### P1

**1 non-organic Storm Cloud** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an
**unlured level 12** cog.

#### The math

```python
  80 + 88 + ceil((80 + 88) / 5)
= 168     + ceil(168       / 5)
= 168     + ceil(33.6)
= 168     + 34
= 202
```

#### When

Like most non-situational strategies, this one is pretty general, but it tends
to be more useful in lureless situations for the obvious reason that it
doesn&rsquo;t require the cog to be lured.

### P2

**1 non-organic Fire Hose** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out a **lured
level 12** cog.

#### The math

```python
  30 + 88 + ceil((30 + 88) / 5) + ceil((30 + 88) / 2)
= 118     + ceil(118       / 5) + ceil(118       / 2)
= 118     + ceil(23.6)          + ceil(59)
= 118     + 24                  + 59
= 201
```

### P3a

**4 organic Fire Hoses** takes out an **unlured level 11** cog.

#### The math

```python
  33 * 4 + ceil(33 * 4 / 5)
= 132    + ceil(132    / 5)
= 132    + ceil(26.4)
= 132    + 27
= 159
```

#### When

Despite being a pure strategy, this one is pretty highly situational: it
requires that all 4 toons have organic squirt, and is a hyper-conservative
strategy that is mostly useful in situations where gags are scarce. That being
said, in these situations it is incredibly powerful, so it deserves a place in
this document.

### P3b

**4 organic Seltzer Bottles** takes out a **lured level 11** cog.

#### The math

```python
  23 * 4 + ceil(23 * 4 / 5) + ceil(23 * 4 / 2)
= 92     + ceil(92     / 5) + ceil(92     / 2)
= 92     + ceil(18.4)       + ceil(46)
= 92     + 19               + 46
= 157
```

#### When

This is the lure version of P3a, so the comments that apply to P3a apply here
as well.

### P4

**2 non-organic Fire Hoses** and **1 organic Fire Hose** takes out a **lured
level 11** cog.

#### The math

```python
  30 + 30 + 33 + ceil((30 + 30 + 33) / 5) + ceil((30 + 30 + 33) / 2)
= 93           + ceil(93             / 5) + ceil(93             / 2)
= 93           + ceil(18.6)               + ceil(46.5)
= 93           + 19                       + 47
= 159
```

#### When

The main purpose of this strategy is to conserve a single Cream Pie (which does
anywhere from 7 to 14 more damage than a Fire Hose, albeit less accurately),
although obviously it is also quite useful when one or more toon(s) are
throwless. If running low on Fruit Pies, this can even save 2 or 3 Cream Pies.

### P5

**1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out a **lured level 10** cog.

#### The math

```python
  88 + ceil(88 / 2)
= 88 + ceil(44)
= 88 + 44
= 132
```

#### Comments

This is what people usually think of when they think of organic squirt, because
it is simple, effective, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; requires no
coordination/teamwork.

### P6

**2 non-organic Fire Hoses** and **1 organic Fire Hose** takes out an **unlured
level 9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  30 + 30 + 33 + ceil((30 + 30 + 33) / 5)
= 93           + ceil(93             / 5)
= 93           + ceil(18.6)
= 93           + 19
= 112
```

#### When

This strategy is similar to P4, as the main purpose of this strategy is to
conserve a single Cream Pie (possibly more if running low on Fruit Pies), and
it is also quite useful when one or more toon(s) are throwless. But this
strategy differs in that it is mostly *only useful in a lureless context*.

### P7

**2 organic Fire Hoses** takes out a **lured level 9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  33 + 33 + ceil((33 + 33) / 5) + ceil((33 + 33) / 2)
= 66      + ceil(66        / 5) + ceil(66        / 2)
= 66      + ceil(13.2)          + ceil(33)
= 66      + 14                  + 33
= 113
```

#### When

This strategy is similar to P4, as the main purpose of this strategy is to
conserve a single Cream Pie (or 2 if running low on Fruit Pies), and it is also
quite useful when one or more toon(s) are throwless.

### P8

**2 non-organic Seltzer Bottles** and **1 organic Seltzer Bottle** takes out a
**lured level 9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  21 + 21 + 23 + ceil((21 + 21 + 23) / 5) + ceil((21 + 21 + 23) / 2)
= 65           + ceil(65             / 5) + ceil(65             / 2)
= 65           + ceil(13)                 + ceil(32.5)
= 65           + 13                       + 33
= 111
```

#### When

This is a kind of hyper-conservative strategy that is mostly useful in
situations where gags are scarce. Effectively, this strategy can save you up to
3 Fruit Pies by replacing them with Seltzer Bottles, which do anywhere from 4
to 8 less damage (albeit more accurately). Also obviously useful with one or
more throwless toon(s).
