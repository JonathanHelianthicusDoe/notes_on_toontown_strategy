TTR only allows for a single gag track to be organic, so one part of every
toon&rsquo;s loadout (besides which gag track(s) they actually have access to)
is what track they choose to plant. Typically the choice is between sound and
throw. [I talk about planting drop in another
document](../organic_drop/README.md) mirroring this one. Lure is a common
choice for those training lure and for those who rely heavily on lure when
playing with others who they don&rsquo;t know (and thus cannot trust to
properly stun for the lure). Trap is also fairly useful and is occasionally
seen, but its usefulness is marginal within &ldquo;normal&rdquo; play; most
organic trap users that I have met say that they mostly just wanted their
railroad to one-shot level 12s (although there are at least three other
regularly useful combos involving organic trap). Organic toonup is vastly
underpowered in normal play, and is thus *exceedingly* rare.

These notes focus on the (in my opinion) severely underestimated underdog of
the bunch: organic squirt. The focus of this document is *not* to convince the
reader to use organic squirt, and when using organic squirt your mileage may
vary wildly, depending on which gag tracks you have access to, who you play
with, and what cogs in the game you fight the most. Instead, these are notes
(maybe even a kind of guide) based on *my personal experience* (with all the
associated arithmetic included, of course) using organic squirt on soundless
toons (with variously 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 gag tracks on each toon). This is not an
exhaustive list of every possible way of defeating any given level of cog using
at least one organic squirt gag; this is a practical guide that does deal with
discrete strategies, but only ones that *make practical sense* within
playstyles that I have personally encountered. Plenty of possibly viable
strategies are indeed *intentionally omitted* here.

These notes are split into two parts: a short preliminary/introduction,
followed by a collection of notes on strategies that can be used with organic
squirt.

The strategies covered here are roughly divided up into three kinds: pure,
mixed, and situational. &ldquo;Pure&rdquo; strategies are straightforward and
only involve squirt gags (although they may deal with cogs that are lured or
unlured). &ldquo;Mixed&rdquo; strategies are only slightly less
straightforward, and involve at least one gag track that isn&rsquo;t squirt.
&ldquo;Situational&rdquo; strategies are not quite so straightforward, and are
situational in the sense that they generally span multiple rounds (thus only
making sense within certain cog fights, not just against certain individual
cogs) and/or require special preparation. Within each of the three kinds,
strategies are not in order of &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; or anything like that,
but are merely ordered by the following, in descending order of priority:

1. Strategies that involve one or more v2.0 cogs are ordered first;
2. Strategies are ordered by the highest level of cog that is involved,
   descending;
3. Strategies that do not involve lure are ordered first;
4. Strategies that involve fewer organic gags are ordered first.

Tie-breaking after this is arbitrary. This ordering is supposed to reflect
something like (very roughly) &ldquo;higher raw gag damage comes first&rdquo;.

## Preliminary

### Key

The percentage in square brackets to the right of each strategy name is the
probability of every part of the strategy hitting (and thus defeating) the cog.
This probability assumes that the lure has already hit (and thus effectively
has 100% accuracy), unless the strategy involves trap, in which case it is
assumed that the lure is as accurate as a non-organic Hypno Goggles
(equivalently, non-organic $10 Bill, organic Blue Magnet, or organic $5 Bill).

One or more of the following indicators appear to the right of the accuracy
percentage:

* &#x1f30a;, &#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;, &#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;,
  &#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;&#x1f30a; : Requires 1, 2, 3, or 4 toons with
  organic squirt, respectively.
* &#x1f9f2; : Requires lure.
* &#x1f333; : Requires one or more organic gag(s) that are not squirt.
* &#x1f35e; : Particularly commonly used (in my personal experience).

### Why organic squirt?

It is common for people to assume that organic squirt is useless; after all,
squirt gags do less damage per-gag than, say, throw gags (and drop gags, and
trap gags), and organic status gives extra damage per-gag as a multiple of the
gag&rsquo;s base damage. So, naturally, it is assumed that organic squirt is
plain old inferior to the other option(s).

This is a misunderstanding based on an (extremely) crude evaluation of the
value of gags themselves. This misunderstanding is, however, entirely expected
given that:

1. *Most* cog facilities are not that lengthy (in terms of something like the
   sum of all cogs&rsquo; raw HP values), so in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; play, you
   can simply sound-spam your way through all, or almost all, of the facility.
   Once a facility is complete, toons are free to restock their gags at any gag
   shoppe.
2. Although Toontown (in general: including not just TTO, but also TTR and
   other &ldquo;private servers&rdquo; that are ultimately derivatives of TTO)
   is a game *designed to force teamwork*, due to the previous point, players
   are *de facto* only incentivised to go as far as memorizing a few
   &ldquo;combos&rdquo; that require little (if any) team coordination. More
   &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; players only go slightly further than this (with
   cooperation strategies like e.g. the avoidance of &ldquo;crossing&rdquo;),
   ultimately also wanting the same thing: a small, fixed set of gag combos
   (ideally as simple as possible, like a single-gag combo, a.k.a. one-shot
   combo) that can be easily memorized by all toons in common, each one of
   which otherwise *requires no teamwork* other than having a shared set of
   memorized combos.
3. Toons cannot (again, in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; play) go sad.

If the above three points are all collectively a given as far as you&rsquo;re
concerned, then this document is probably not for you. If all three points
above are true 100% of the time, then you are better off with either organic
sound or organic throw, as those are the only two viable options (in terms of
raw game-mechanical advantage, with the slight exception of an organic Storm
Cloud being able to one-shot a lured level 10 cog). That being said, there are
two things that make the above three assumptions questionable:

1. The existence of Bossbot HQ, specifically Back Nines and CEOs. Depending on
   how lucky you get with the golf minigame, point no. 1 above may or may not
   actually apply. And in CEOs, there is simply no chance (other than the
   spending of SOS cards and/or unites) of getting gag restocks. This point
   also applies to a lesser extent to some shorter facilities like Middle
   Sixes, DA Office Ds, Bullion Mints, and CFOs.
2. The existence of alternate (not &ldquo;normal&rdquo;) styles of play, which
   are ultimately optional (as is any style of play), and sometimes require
   self-imposed restrictions beyond what the game provides as-is. This includes
   (but is not limited to) soundless toons, semi toons, and uber toons (and
   toons that are any combination of one or more of the former).

If we take these things into account (and thus take the original three
assumptions into question), we arrive at a more *general* version of Toontown,
in which the reasoning that organic squirt is obviously useless no longer
applies. Instead, when reasoning about what organic gag track to choose, our
reasoning has to look more like the following rough sketch:

We want to *minimize* the amount of &ldquo;power&rdquo; (loosely speaking, the
somewhat situational power-to-defeat-cogs that takes into account raw gag
damage as well as other things like ability to produce &ldquo;combo
damage&rdquo; (yellow damage) and &ldquo;knockback damage&rdquo; (orange
damage), &amp;c.) that is used to defeat any given cog (or set of cogs). In
this way, we *maximize* how much power we conserve overall that can be used to
defeat future cog(s).

If it seems like this reasoning still views organic squirt as useless (or at
least, underpowered), then you are forgetting that Toontown puts an absolute
maximum on the number of gags that you can carry of any particular variety
(e.g. a hard maximum of 3 Birthday Cakes). Because of this, it will (at least,
in many cases) make sense to empower gags that are less powerful per-gag, thus
having more gags in one&rsquo;s inventory that exceed a particular power
threshold. This is as opposed to empowering gags that are *more* powerful
per-gag; doing this will increase the number of gags in one&rsquo;s inventory
that exceed a particular power threshold, but that threshold *will be
considerably higher, and as a result the absolute number of gags that exceed it
will be fewer anyways*. This can actually work *against* the criteria in the
previous paragraph, and is the (somewhat subtle) reasoning that vindicates the
use of seemingly underpowered things like organic squirt.

All of this being said, it is worth reiterating that I in no way claim that
organic squirt is the only viable option for an organic gag track in all
situations, because that claim is very much false. What I do claim is that in
many situations and in many gag builds, organic squirt is a good choice and/or
the best choice. I also claim that in my personal experience, organic squirt
has served me very well across a variety of different toons with different gag
tracks. I have already made [a document similar to this one for organic
drop](../organic_drop/README.md), and may even make one for organic throw, in
the future.

### Basic squirt knowledge

The damage values of squirt gags (and their organic versions) are listed below:

| Level | Name             | Damage | Damage (organic) |
| ----: | :--------------- | -----: | ---------------: |
| 1     | Squirting Flower | 4      | 5                |
| 2     | Glass Of Water   | 8      | 9                |
| 3     | Squirtgun        | 12     | 13               |
| 4     | Seltzer Bottle   | 21     | 23               |
| 5     | Fire Hose        | 30     | 33               |
| 6     | Storm Cloud      | 80     | 88               |
| 7     | Geyser           | 105    | 115              |

Squirt gags are effectively as accurate as sound gags (slightly complicated by
the fact that sound gags hit all cogs, and squirt gags hit one cog at a time
with the exception of the Geyser). Toons with max squirt have a 95% chance of
hitting any unlured cog with their squirt gags, and all toons have a 100%
chance of hitting any lured cog with their squirt gags. This is in contrast to
throw gags, which are similar to squirt gags but have worse accuracy on unlured
cogs whose level is 10 or higher (assuming max throw).

## Pure strategies

### P0a [95%] &#x1f30a;

**2 non-organic Fire Hoses**, **1 non-organic Storm Cloud**, and **1 organic
Storm Cloud** takes out an **unlured level 10 v2.0** cog.

#### The math

```python
# First shell
  30 + 30 + 80
= 140

# Second shell
  88 + ceil((30 + 30 + 80 + 88) / 5)
= 88 + ceil(228                 / 5)
= 88 + ceil(45.6)
= 88 + 46
= 134
```

#### When

In a lureless context where you have 2 or more dropless toons (actually
dropless, or just don&rsquo;t have any Safes left).

### P0b [95%] &#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;

**1 organic Seltzer Bottle**, **1 non-organic Fire Hose**, **1 non-organic
Storm Cloud**, and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an **unlured level 10
v2.0** cog.

#### The math

```python
# First shell
  23 + 30 + 80
= 133

# Second shell
  88 + ceil((23 + 30 + 80 + 88) / 5)
= 88 + ceil(221                 / 5)
= 88 + ceil(44.2)
= 88 + 45
= 133
```

#### When

This is just P0a, but with 2 organic squirt gags required. The same comments
apply.

### P1 [95%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f35e;

**1 non-organic Storm Cloud** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an
**unlured level 12** cog.

#### The math

```python
  80 + 88 + ceil((80 + 88) / 5)
= 168     + ceil(168       / 5)
= 168     + ceil(33.6)
= 168     + 34
= 202
```

#### When

Like most non-situational strategies, this one is pretty general, but it tends
to be more useful in lureless situations for the obvious reason that it
doesn&rsquo;t require the cog to be lured.

### P2 [100%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2; &#x1f35e;

**1 non-organic Fire Hose** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out a **lured
level 12** cog.

#### The math

```python
  30 + 88 + ceil((30 + 88) / 5) + ceil((30 + 88) / 2)
= 118     + ceil(118       / 5) + ceil(118       / 2)
= 118     + ceil(23.6)          + ceil(59)
= 118     + 24                  + 59
= 201
```

### P3a [95%] &#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;

**4 organic Fire Hoses** takes out an **unlured level 11** cog.

#### The math

```python
  33 * 4 + ceil(33 * 4 / 5)
= 132    + ceil(132    / 5)
= 132    + ceil(26.4)
= 132    + 27
= 159
```

#### When

Despite being a pure strategy, this one is pretty highly situational: it
requires that all 4 toons have organic squirt, and is a hyper-conservative
strategy that is mostly useful in situations where gags are scarce. That being
said, in these situations it is incredibly powerful, so it deserves a place in
this document.

### P3b [100%] &#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;&#x1f30a;&#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2;

**4 organic Seltzer Bottles** takes out a **lured level 11** cog.

#### The math

```python
  23 * 4 + ceil(23 * 4 / 5) + ceil(23 * 4 / 2)
= 92     + ceil(92     / 5) + ceil(92     / 2)
= 92     + ceil(18.4)       + ceil(46)
= 92     + 19               + 46
= 157
```

#### When

This is the lure version of P3a, so the comments that apply to P3a apply here
as well.

### P4 [100%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2; &#x1f35e;

**2 non-organic Fire Hoses** and **1 organic Fire Hose** takes out a **lured
level 11** cog.

#### The math

```python
  30 + 30 + 33 + ceil((30 + 30 + 33) / 5) + ceil((30 + 30 + 33) / 2)
= 93           + ceil(93             / 5) + ceil(93             / 2)
= 93           + ceil(18.6)               + ceil(46.5)
= 93           + 19                       + 47
= 159
```

#### When

The main purpose of this strategy is to conserve a single Cream Pie (which does
anywhere from 7 to 14 more damage than a Fire Hose, albeit less accurately),
although obviously it is also quite useful when 1 or more toon(s) are
throwless. If running low on Fruit Pies, this can even save 2 or 3 Cream Pies.

### P5 [100%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2; &#x1f35e;

**1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out a **lured level 10** cog.

#### The math

```python
  88 + ceil(88 / 2)
= 88 + ceil(44)
= 88 + 44
= 132
```

#### Comments

This is what people usually think of when they think of organic squirt, because
it is simple, effective, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; requires no
coordination/teamwork.

### P6 [95%] &#x1f30a;

**2 non-organic Fire Hoses** and **1 organic Fire Hose** takes out an **unlured
level 9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  30 + 30 + 33 + ceil((30 + 30 + 33) / 5)
= 93           + ceil(93             / 5)
= 93           + ceil(18.6)
= 93           + 19
= 112
```

#### When

This strategy is similar to P4, as the main purpose of this strategy is to
conserve a single Cream Pie (possibly more if running low on Fruit Pies), and
it is also quite useful when 1 or more toon(s) are throwless. But this strategy
differs in that it is mostly *only useful in a lureless context*.

### P7 [100%] &#x1f30a;&#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2; &#x1f35e;

**2 organic Fire Hoses** takes out a **lured level 9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  33 + 33 + ceil((33 + 33) / 5) + ceil((33 + 33) / 2)
= 66      + ceil(66        / 5) + ceil(66        / 2)
= 66      + ceil(13.2)          + ceil(33)
= 66      + 14                  + 33
= 113
```

#### When

This strategy is similar to P4, as the main purpose of this strategy is to
conserve a single Cream Pie (or 2 if running low on Fruit Pies), and it is also
quite useful when 1 or more toon(s) are throwless.

### P8 [100%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2;

**2 non-organic Seltzer Bottles** and **1 organic Seltzer Bottle** takes out a
**lured level 9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  21 + 21 + 23 + ceil((21 + 21 + 23) / 5) + ceil((21 + 21 + 23) / 2)
= 65           + ceil(65             / 5) + ceil(65             / 2)
= 65           + ceil(13)                 + ceil(32.5)
= 65           + 13                       + 33
= 111
```

#### When

This is a kind of hyper-conservative strategy that is mostly useful in
situations where gags are scarce. Effectively, this strategy can save you up to
3 Fruit Pies by replacing them with Seltzer Bottles, which do anywhere from 4
to 8 less damage (albeit more accurately). Also obviously useful with 1 or more
throwless toon(s).

## Mixed strategies

<!-- TODO: Maybe add a combo of **1 non-organic Storm Cloud**, **1 organic
Storm Cloud**, **1 non-organic Big Weight**, and **1 non-organic Safe** takes
out a **lured level 12 v2.0** cog? -->

### X0a [90.25%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f35e;

**1 non-organic Fire Hose**, **1 organic Storm Cloud**, and **1 non-organic
Safe** takes out an **unlured level 12** cog.

#### The math

```python
  30 + 88 + ceil((30 + 88) / 5) + 60
= 118     + ceil(118       / 5) + 60
= 118     + ceil(23.6)          + 60
= 118     + 24                  + 60
= 202
```

#### When

Similar to P1, but less expensive in terms of gags at the cost of requiring 3
toons (instead of 2) and being slightly less accurate (in particular, less
accurate by 4.75 percentage points). Like P1, this is very useful in lureless
contexts (esp. [KPSS](https://kpss.neocities.org/)).

### X0b [90.25%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f333; &#x1f35e;

**1 organic Fire Hose**, **1 non-organic Storm Cloud**, and **1 organic Safe**
takes out an **unlured level 12** cog.

#### The math

```python
  33 + 80 + ceil((33 + 80) / 5) + 66
= 113     + ceil(113       / 5) + 66
= 113     + ceil(22.6)          + 66
= 113     + 23                  + 66
= 202
```

#### When

Variant of X0a that is generally preferable in the case that you have someone
with organic drop.

#### Comments

See [strategy X8 in the notes on organic
drop](../organic_drop/README.md#x8-9025--).

### X1 [90.25%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f333;

**1 non-organic Elephant Trunk**, **1 organic Elephant Trunk**, **1 non-organic
Foghorn**, and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an **unlured level 12** cog.

#### The math

```python
  21 + 23 + 50 + ceil((21 + 23 + 50) / 5) + 88
= 94           + ceil(94             / 5) + 88
= 94           + ceil(18.8)               + 88
= 94           + 19                       + 88
= 201
```

#### When

This is mostly a CEO strategy, where the so-called &ldquo;one-fog rule&rdquo;
prevails, but so do level 12 cogs. In my experience, the strategy looks like 1
Foghorn, 2 Elephant Trunks, and 1 Birthday Cake to take out (either the first
or second shell of) a level 12 cog. Due to organic sound&rsquo;s high
popularity and the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which one (or more) of the
sound gags are organic, this is a common way to save a Birthday Cake (which
does 12 more damage, albeit less accurately).

That being said, this also works any time there is a level 12 cog, and some
other cogs whose individual HPs do not currently exceed 113 or so.

#### Comments

Note, again, that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which one (or more) of the sound gags
are organic.

### X2 [90.25%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2;

**1 non-organic Trapdoor** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out a **lured
level 11** cog.

#### The math

```python
  70 + 88
= 158
```

#### When

The purpose of this strategy is to stun for the lure, which increases its
percentage chance of hitting by 20 percentage points (up to a maximum of 95, of
course). For example, if using non-organic Hypno Goggles when the highest level
cog being lured is 12, this increases accuracy from 75% to 95%. It&rsquo;s also
fast (just 1 round) and doesn&rsquo;t cost too much extra: the cheapest way to
defeat a lured level 11 cog with 2 toons is probably a non-organic Storm Cloud
and a non-organic Seltzer Bottle (or Squirtgun, for that matter), whereas here
we are only spending a non-organic Trapdoor instead of a Seltzer Bottle (not
bad at all), and an organic Storm Cloud instead of a non-organic one. Thus, it
can often be very worth using this strategy just to reduce the chance of lure
missing.

#### Comments

This also works if the organic gags are flipped, that is, an organic Trapdoor
and a non-organic Storm Cloud.

### X3a [90.25%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f35e;

**2 non-organic Elephant Trunks** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an
**unlured level 10** cog.

#### The math

```python
  21 + 21 + ceil((21 + 21) / 5) + 88
= 42      + ceil(42        / 5) + 88
= 42      + ceil(8.4)           + 88
= 42      + 9                   + 88
= 139
```

#### When

Useful when only 1 or 2 cogs on the battlefield have more than roughly 50 HP
left (either because they are damaged or are just low level) or just in cases
where you want to save Foghorns or are with one or more soundless toon(s).

### X3b [90.25%] &#x1f30a;

**1 non-organic Foghorn** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an **unlured
level 10** cog.

#### The math

```python
  50 + 88
= 138
```

#### When

Useful with one or more soundless toon(s) or just in cases where you want to
save Foghorns. I mostly find myself using this one in CFO, but it&rsquo;s
useful elsewhere as well. E.g. 2 level 12 cogs, 1 level 10 cog, and possibly
one other cog can be treated in a single round with 1 non-organic Foghorn, 1
organic Storm Cloud, and 2 non-organic Grand Pianos. But it also comes in handy
over the course of multiple rounds, as you would expect.

### X4 [90.25%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f333;

**1 organic Elephant Trunk** and **1 organic Storm Cloud** takes out an
**unlured level 9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  23 + 88
= 111
```

#### When

Useful when just using an Elephant trunk to stun, which is common in lureless
contexts and/or contexts where you want to make use of drop gag(s).

### X5 [90%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2;

**1 organic Fire Hose** and **1 non-organic Safe** takes out a **lured level
9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  33 + ceil(33 / 2) + 60
= 33 + ceil(16.5)   + 60
= 33 + 17           + 60
= 110
```

#### When

This strategy is mostly useful when Cream Pies are scarce and/or in high
demand, but Safes are not.

Also, this strategy doubles as an organic drop strategy: [**1 non-organic Fire
Hose** and **1 organic Safe** takes out a **lured level 9**
cog](../organic_drop/README.md#x13-90--).

#### Comments

Believe it or not, TTR sometimes bungles cog HP calculations! I&rsquo;ve known
about a bug that, among other things, affects this particular strategy, causing
the cog not to die even though it has 0 (or fewer) HP. [See
here](../ttr_quirks/README.md#cogs-with-less-than-one-hp-do-not-die) for more
details.

### X6 [90.25%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2; &#x1f333;

**1 organic Trapdoor** and **1 organic Fire Hose** takes out a **lured level
9** cog.

#### The math

```python
  77 + 33
= 110
```

#### When

Similar to X2, the purpose here is a fast and cheap way of stunning and
significantly lessening the chance of lure missing.

## Situational strategies

### S0 [85%] &#x1f30a; &#x1f9f2; &#x1f35e;

**1 non-organic Storm Cloud** and **1 organic Storm Cloud**, followed by **1
non-organic Cream Pie** takes out a **lured level 11 v2.0** cog.

#### The math

```python
# First shell
  80 + 88
= 168

# Second shell
  ceil((80 + 88) / 5) + ceil((80 + 88) / 2) + 40
= ceil(168       / 5) + ceil(168       / 2) + 40
= ceil(33.6)          + ceil(84)            + 40
= 34                  + 84                  + 40
= 158
```

#### When

So, obviously this is a BBHQ strategy as it involves a v2.0 cog. But more
specifically, when doing cog golf courses (e.g. Back Nines), the second fight
on every floor is 2 level 11 cogs and 2 level 11 v2.0 cogs. When doing this
fight without enough Foghorns (because y&rsquo;all collectively ran out, and/or
there are soundless toon(s) in your party), this strategy (ideally) looks
something like:

1. Round 1: 1 toon that has lure starts the battle and uses Hypno Goggles (or
   similar) to lure the cogs.
2. The other 3 toons in the party join the battle.
3. Round 2: 2 Storm Clouds are used on each of the level 11 v2.0 cogs. Note
   that if you have more than one toon with organic squirt, you may have to
   &ldquo;cross&rdquo; in order to ensure that both level 11 v2.0 cogs are hit
   by at least one organic Storm Cloud.
4. Round 3: Each toon with organic squirt uses a Cream Pie on the cog that they
   hit in the last round (round 2); if there are more than 2 toons with organic
   squirt, then not all of them will throw a Cream Pie (as only one is needed
   for each level 11 v2.0 cog). Also in the case that there are more than 2
   toons with organic squirt, an organic Fire Hose can be used in place of a
   non-organic Cream Pie, since a level 11 v2.0 cog has only 32 HP after being
   hit with 2 organic Storm Clouds while lured. If there is only one toon with
   organic squirt, then there will be a level 11 v2.0 cog left with 44 HP.
   Usually this one is taken out with an organic Cream Pie, but other things
   are possible, like 1 non-organic Big Weight (60% accuracy without stun) or 2
   non-organic Seltzer Bottles. Any toons not using their gags to finish off
   the level 11 v2.0 cogs can work on the normal (and still lured) level 11
   cogs, or whatever.

Note that it is typical for there to be either 1 organic squirt and 3 organic
throw toons, or 2 of each, in which case round 3 can be the last round by
making use of 2 organic Birthday Cakes.

#### Comments

This strategy is actually more like an &ldquo;organic squirt and/or organic
throw&rdquo; strategy than an organic squirt strategy, because if 2 non-organic
Storm Clouds are used instead, the cog is left with 44 HP: exactly enough to be
defeated by an organic Cream Pie. I have used some variation of this strategy
many times in soundless Back Nines (and Middle Sixes/Front Threes, for that
matter).
